Rubik's Cube Solver 

Important :  In this project color detection mechanism strongly depends on - 
			1. environment lighting
			2. cube's color code
			3. image quality of the camera
		    

	    Solution :    If programme canâ€™t detect the perfectly change in the hsv range of the colors in hsv_to_name function(in colorDetection.py).
	    		  You can also take help of get_hsv funtion(in colorDetection.py) to find right hsv value.



Steps:

1. Install the following libraries -
	a. opencv-python
	b. kociemba
	c. requests 

2. Download ip webcam in mobile
3. Open it and connect pc and mobile in same network
4. Click start server in it (last option)
5. Open URL(visible in bottom) on your browser (URL like = "http://192.178.56.100:8080")
6. Click JavaScript in 'video render' section in this site
7. You can see video running, right click on it and click 'open image in new tab'
8. New tab will be open, copy the URL and paste it URL variable in scan function (in colordetection.py file)
9. Run the 'cube.py'
10. Scan all six sides carefully. Don't rotate the cube z-axis(only x, y axis rotation allow). Sequence does not matter
	spacebar : to scan side (hold cube Infront of the camera and click spacebar)
	Esc : to terminate the programme

11. If all steps are right solution will come. Follow the instructions -> solved cube :)
